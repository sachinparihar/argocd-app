      <description>Overview Serverless Computing is a way of building and running applications and services without having infrastructure. This means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about maintaining servers to run your code, as an infrastructure managed by a cloud provider(aws, azure, gcp cloud).
Serverless doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that they don&amp;rsquo;t have servers. There are still servers but they are abstracted away from app development. It means that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to maintain, provision, or scale servers, you only need to focus development side.</description>
